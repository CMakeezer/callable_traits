Current Version: 2.1.1

CallableTraits is a C++11 header-only library for the inspection, synthesis, and decomposition of callable types.

[Documentation for the development version available here.](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/callable_traits/doc/html/index.html)

On April 17, 2017, CallableTraits was [formally reviewed](http://www.boost.org/community/reviews.html) and [conditionally accepted](https://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2017/04/234513.php) into the Boost C++ Libraries. It has since been accepted and merged, with an expected release in Boost 1.66 (December 2017).
